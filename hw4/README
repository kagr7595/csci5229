 *  HW4: Projections
 *  Course: CSCI5229
 *  Author: Kathy Grimes
 *  Description:  This program is built upon hwk3 and uses a variety examples including ex9.
 *                Also needed to peruse the web for some help with first person.  
 *                I saw some other ways first person was implemented but this version made the most sense to me.
 *                This homework requires three view modes: 
 *                      Overhead orthogonal, Overhead perspective, and First person
 *    Please use the following keys to manipulate the program during run
 *                 1: toggles between Orthogonal, Perspective, and First Person
 *              in Orthogonal or Perspective...
 *                 o: overhead view (y-axis view)  
 *              in First Person...   
 *           5,6,7,8: forward,backward,right,left
 *              in all views
 *               f/F: change field_of_view
 *            Arrows: move angles of ph and th (for all perspectives)
 *                 p: pause flying kitty
 *                 m: change mixed kitty coloring/size
 *                 a: toggle axis
 *                 i: go back to initial state values (in case you get off course in the viewing screen)

  To run, open directory of Makefile and hw4.c:	
    make clean
    make hw4
    ./hw4

Approximate time:  About 16 hours.  I had so much trouble getting some of the modes to work because of 
                   stupid coding issues and that caused me to delay for a couple of hours.  The first 
                   person took the longest as I couldn't seem to figure out what was going on in order 
                   for it to move correctly.
