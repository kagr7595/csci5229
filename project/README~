 *  Project: Count Learning Activity for my Niece
 *  Course: CSCI5229
 *  Author: Kathy Grimes
 *  Description:  This program is built upon all the previous hwk
 *                 and examples in class as well as using the opengl
 *                 online resources for formulae/ideas/inspiration
 *
 *                 Although not one of the main things taught in this course,
 *                 I relearned pointers so that I could create a more realistic
 *                 tree (not a simple pine  tree) that could be randomized to 
 *                 be different each run.  I was even ready to use mutliple random
 *                 trees but had to give up that idea.
 *
 *                 The program starts with the tree as an added element, 
 *                 however, due to the number and types of objects being 
 *                 rendered, it was very slow to use with the learning 
 *                 activity so I remove it when I start the game until I 
 *                 have all the CULL FACEs fixed.  I was not able to finish 
 *                 fixing all of them so I commented them out in my code.
 *
 *                 The starting screen as informative lighting elements on 
 *                 the screen to make it easier to understand the starting mode.  
 *                  As in previous assignments, I left these special keys to change 
 *                 the various lighting parameters in and have found some 
 *                 interesting looking environments.
 *
 *                 Press <Enter> to progress to the learning/counting activity 
 *                 (which is only one activity as it took me much longer 
 *                 than I thought to make my tree)
 *
 *                 The most important keys are <Enter>, Up/Down Arrows 
 *                 (for counting the objects during the activity), 
 *                 and Left/Right Arrows to change the view angle(th).
 *                 To progress you must answer correctly otherwise you will be 
 *                 returned to 'try again'
 *
 *                 Answer is: 7 apples, 4 balls, 3 cats.
 *
 *                 <Esc> to exit
 *
 *                 I tried to make it look like the three cats owned the 
 *                 three houses and they each had their own color coded ball 
 *                 and they liked to eat apples ;)
 *
 *                 The one portion of the project I was unable to get working 
 *                 was the object select drag feature.  I was trying to implement
 *                 based off of color and making all the objects a 'unique' color 
 *                 but found that this wouldn't work for what I wanted to use it 
 *                 for and I needed to follow a different path that I wasn't able 
 *                 to implement in time.  Due to not having the object selection I 
 *                 revised my activities so that I could use the majority of the pieces 
 *                 I had created for the color/alphabet in the counting activity
 * 
 *
 *    Please use the following keys to manipulate the program during run
 *              in Perspective...
 *                 o: overhead view (y-axis view)
 *               f/F: change field_of_view
 *              in all views
 * Left/Right Arrows: move angles of th
 *    Up/Down Arrows: when menu overlay in effect, up/down arrows are to control counting of objects in game
 *                  : when old style text on screen (game not occurring) move angles of ph 
 *                 p: pause light ball
 *                 x: toggle axis
 *                 i: go back to initial state values (in case you get off want to start the game over)
 *     Lighting
 *                []: Lower/raise light
 *               q/Q: Lower/raise light distance from (0,0,0)
 *               a/A: Decrease/increase ambient light
 *               d/D: Decrease/increase diffuse light
 *               s/S: Decrease/increase specular light
 *               e/E: Decrease/increase emitted light
 *               n/N: Decrease/increase shininess
 *                 l: Toggles lighting
 *                F1: Toggle Smooth/Flat lighting
 *                F2: Toggle localized lighing
 *     Textures
 *                 t: Toggle between two sets of textures for the light orb/moon orb
 *                 T: Toggle Texture mode (replace/modulate)
 *

  To run, open directory where makefile lives:	
    make clean
    make
    ./fproject

Approximate time:  Probably 100 hours.  I got stuck in so many places, I feel that I was debugging for 70% of the time.
