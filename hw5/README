 *  HW5: Lighting
 *  Course: CSCI5229
 *  Author: Kathy Grimes
 *  Description:  This program is built upon hwk4 and uses a variety examples including ex13.
 *                This homework's purpose is experience with determining normal vectors for lighting calculations. 
 *                For debugging and grading, light should be able to be stopped and moved
 *
 *    Please use the following keys to manipulate the program during run
 *                 1: toggles between Orthogonal, Perspective, and First Person
 *              in Orthogonal *                 
 *       PgUp/PgDown: Decrease/increase dim
 *              in Orthogonal or Perspective...
 *                 o: overhead view (y-axis view)  
 *              in First Person...   
 *           5,6,7,8: forward,backward,right,left
 *              in First Person or Perspective
 *               f/F: change field_of_view
 *              in all views
 *            Arrows: move angles of ph and th (for all perspectives)
 *                 p: pause flying kitty AND light ball
 *                 m: change mixed kitty coloring/size
 *                 x: toggle axis
 *                 i: go back to initial state values (in case you get off course in the viewing screen)
 *     Lighting in all views
 *                []: Lower/raise light
 *               q/Q: Lower/raise light distance from (0,0,0)
 *               a/A: Decrease/increase ambient light
 *               d/D: Decrease/increase diffuse light
 *               s/S: Decrease/increase specular light
 *               e/E: Decrease/increase emitted light
 *               n/N: Decrease/increase shininess
 *                 l: Toggles lighting
 *                F1: Toggle Smooth/Flat lighting
 *                F2: Toggle localized lighing
 *

  To run, open directory of Makefile and hw5.c:	
    make clean
    make hw5
    ./hw5

Approximate time:  About 14 hours.  The ears for the kitty I am still not sure are completely right.  
                   I created a function to calculate the normal however I had to play around with the 
                   vertice order in order for the lighting to occur on the correct side.
