 *  HW6: Textures
 *  Course: CSCI5229
 *  Author: Kathy Grimes
 *  Description:  This program is built upon hwk5 and uses a variety examples including ex15/16/18.
 *                This homework's purpose is to experience texture use with lighting and three dimensional viewing. 
 *                No pyramids, GLU/GLUT objects
 *
 *    Please use the following keys to manipulate the program during run
 *                 1: toggles between Orthogonal, Perspective, and First Person
 *              in Orthogonal *                 
 *       PgUp/PgDown: Decrease/increase dim
 *              in Orthogonal or Perspective...
 *                 o: overhead view (y-axis view)  
 *              in First Person...   
 *           5,6,7,8: forward,backward,right,left
 *              in First Person or Perspective
 *               f/F: change field_of_view
 *              in all views
 *            Arrows: move angles of ph and th (for all perspectives)
 *                 p: pause flying kitty AND light ball
 *                 m: change mixed kitty coloring/size
 *                 x: toggle axis
 *                 i: go back to initial state values (in case you get off course in the viewing screen)
 *     Lighting in all views
 *                []: Lower/raise light
 *               q/Q: Lower/raise light distance from (0,0,0)
 *               a/A: Decrease/increase ambient light
 *               d/D: Decrease/increase diffuse light
 *               s/S: Decrease/increase specular light
 *               e/E: Decrease/increase emitted light
 *               n/N: Decrease/increase shininess
 *                 l: Toggles lighting
 *                F1: Toggle Smooth/Flat lighting
 *                F2: Toggle localized lighing
 *     Textures in all views
 *                 t: Toggle between two sets of textures for the cats and stage(I really like the example crate image)
 *                 T: Toggle Texture mode (replace/modulate)
 *

  To run, open directory where makefile lives:	
    make clean
    make
    ./hw6

Approximate time:  About 12 hours.  Unfortunately I was not able to spend as much time as I needed.  
                   I was hoping to do something with the eyes but ran out of time this week.  I enjoyed
                   changing the pictures and making the kitties have different graphics on each side, but 
                   changed it in the end to make it look for real rather than 'special'. I even added my own
                   paint picture with 'mrow' (something that is a bit of an inside joke in my family as I love
                   kitties too much).  I think I spent more time trying to figure out what graphics I wanted
                   rather than on the code.
