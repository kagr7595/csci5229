HW2: Lorenz Attractor
Course: CSCI5229
Author: Kathy Grimes
Description:
  Code will reproduce lorenz attractor graph using Line Strip
  
  To run, open directory of Makefile and hw2.c:	
    make clean
    make hw2
    ./hw2

  Graph can be modified interactively using the following keys:
     s/S,b/B,r/R: increment/decrement s, r, or b values by .5
             z/Z: zoom inword/outward by 5
               i: return to inital settings
               p: toggle pause idle spinning
               a: toggle axis
   up/down_arrow: increment/decrement angle - rotate around z axis (please make sure spinning is paused to use this option)
left/right_arrow: increment/decrement angle - rotate around y axis (please make sure spinning is paused to use this option)
 

One interesting thing I learned about the Lorenz attractor 
is the large variation of 'interesting objects' that can be made by shifting variables, 
I was able to make a iteration where it looked like a swinging light bulb.
This could be useful in terms of making a scary themed graphic :)
I never dealt with the lorenz attractor in my previous courses, but the number of 
interesting shapes it could make could be very useful for this course.

I do have a question about my display invalid operation errors I was getting.  
I made sure to switch my glMatricMode from GL_PROJECTION to GL_MODELVIEW, and
that the glBegin always had an glEnd so it would not interfere with the redisplay.
However, I almost always still get invalid operation for my display when I try to 
resize just one side instead of a corner.  I also get the error when I move my
window.  Do you have a suggestion after looking at my code?  I'm have partially 
used the class example code provided for resizing, but maybe because I added a
zoom function, I have caused a sort of interference?  
Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Thank you.
