HW3: Scene in 3D
Course: CSCI5229
Author: Kathy Grimes
Description: A program that creates a multiple instances of a cat object in different locations
             using multiple other objects such as cuboids/spheroids/triangles/quads
             Inside of the cat object are legs, torso, head, tail, ears, and eyes objects
             that have been manipulated by translate/rotate/scaling
     Code Initially was from Example 8 class code
                z/Z: zoom inword/outward by .5
             Arrows: move around axis
                  p: pause flying kitty
                  m: change mixed kitty coloring/size
                  a: toggle axis
  
  
  To run, open directory of Makefile and hw3.c:	
    make clean
    make hw3
    ./hw3

Approximate time:  About 16 hours.  About 8 hours were spent trying to create an apple which I never got right
                   before I moved on to the cat idea.
